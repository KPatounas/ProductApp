In this assignment, you'll be tasked with creating an Android application that fetches 
product data from a provided API and displays the product information in an organized, 
user-friendly interface. 
Your task is to develop an Android application that: 
1. Retrieves a list of products from a given API, 
2. Displays these products on the screen with relevant information in a scrollable layout, 
3. Displays details screen with additional product information when a product is taped 
upon. 

You are free to use the architecture you feel most comfortable with (e.g., MVVM, MVP, etc.). 
However, during the interview you should be able to outline why you chose this architecture 
and how it benefits the overall structure of your application. 

Keep the UI simple and user-friendly. There's no need to spend time on designing fancy 
screensâ€”focus on clear, intuitive layouts that make it easy for users to view the product 
information. 

Application must have a basic error handling. Specifically: 
1. Implement error states for network failures. 
2. Show appropriate messages to users if an error occurs and provide a retry option.
